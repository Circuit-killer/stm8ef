# STM8 eForth (stm8ef)

[![Test](https://travis-ci.org/TG9541/stm8ef.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TG9541/stm8ef)

STM8 eForth is a lightweight self-hosted Forth system for STM8 ÂµCs with a good "feature-to-binary-size" ratio. It provides a [binary release](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/releases), easy configuration, a plug-in system for board support, a library infrastructure, and uCsim based binary level simulation. With the help of [e4thcom](https://wiki.forth-ev.de/doku.php/en:projects:e4thcom) it can be used as a semi-tethered embedded Forth.

STM8 eForth is based on [Dr. C.H. Ting's eForth for the *STM8S Discovery*](http://www.forth.org/svfig/kk/07-2010.html). With the kind permission of the original author, it comes with a permissive [FOSS license](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

The [Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki) covers various topics, e.g. using breakout boards, or the conversion of low-cost Chinese thermostats, voltmeters, or DC/DC-converters into Forth powered embedded control boards.

[![STM8EF Wiki](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5466977/28994765-3267d78c-79d6-11e7-927f-91751cd402db.jpg)](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki)

STM8 eForth can be configured for a range of Forth features and different STM8 devices: a full featured binary requires betwenn 4.7K and 5.3K, a basic interactive Forth fits in about 3.5K, and building even smaller interactive cores is possible. The unique `ALIAS` feature provides temporary access to unlinked words.

The interactive Forth console can use any single GPIO, a pair of GPIOs, or the STM8 UART for 2-wire or 3-wire communication. Up to two serial interfaces can be used with vectored I/O. It's possible to configure the console to use other types of I/O (e.g. keyboard and display), even at runtime.

## Generic targets

Generic target binaries are provided for a quick start:

* STM8S Low Density devices (e.g. STM8S103x3, STM8S003x3, or STM8S001J3)
  *  [CORE](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/tree/master/CORE), a basic configuration for STM8S Low Density devices, some features are disabled (e.g. no background task)

# Feature Overview

Even though the binaries are very small, STM8 eForth offers many features:

* Subroutine Threaded Code (STC) with improved code density
  * native `BRANCH` (JP), and `EXIT` (RET)
  * relative CALL with two bytes where possible
  * pseudo-opcode for DOLIT using TRAP: literals in 3 instead of 5 bytes
  * [ALIAS words](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8-eForth-Alias-Words) for indirect dictionary entries
* compile Forth to NVM (Non Volatile Memory) with IAP
  * Words `NVM` and `RAM` switch between volatile (RAM) and non volatile (NVM) modes (*REMEMBER execute `RAM` before a power recycle or executing `COLD` if you want the words added to NVM to be available in future terminal sessions*)
  * RAM allocation for `VARIABLE` and `ALLOT` is transparent in NVM mode (basic RAM management)
  * autostart feature for embedded applications
* Low-level interrupts in Forth
  * lightweight context switch with `SAVEC` and `IRET`
  * example code for HALT is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8-eForth-Interrupts)
* preemptive background tasks with fixed cycle time
  * configurable cycle (default: 5ms)
  * `INPUT-PROCESS-OUTPUT` task indepent of the Forth console
  * robust and fast context switch with a "clean stack" approach
  * concurrent interactive Forth console, e.g. for setting control process parameters
  * in background tasks `?KEY` reads board keys, and [boards with 7Seg-LED UI](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/eForth-Background-Task) can simply `EMIT` to the LED display
* cooperative multitasking with `'IDLE`
  * code can be executed in an idle task while the console waits for user input
* configuration options for serial console or dual serial interface
  * UART: `?RX` and `TX!`

  * GPIO w/ Port edge & Timer4 interrupts: `?RXP .. TXP!`
  * half-duplex "bus style" communication using simulated COM port or UART
  * option for `TX! .. ?RX` on simulated COM port, and `?RXP .. TXP!` on UART
* configurable vocabulary subsets for binary size optimization
  * configuration possible down to the level of single words
  * export of `ALIAS` definitions for unlinked words
* Extended vocabulary:
  * `CREATE ... DOES>` for defining *defining words*
  * Vectored I/O: `'KEY?` and `'EMIT`
  * Loop structure words: `DO .. LEAVE .. LOOP`, `+LOOP`
  * STM8S ADC control: `ADC!`, `ADC@`

## Other changes to the original STM8EF code:

* "ASxxxx V2.0" syntax (the free [SDCC tool chain](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) allows mixing Forth, assembly, and C)
* hard STM8S105C6 dependencies removed (e.g. RAM layout, UART2)
* flexible RAM layout, basic RAM memory management, meaningful symbols for RAM locations
* conditional code for different target boards with a subdirectory based configuration framework
* bugs fixed (e.g. `COMPILE`, `DEPTH`, `R!`)
* significant binary size reduction
